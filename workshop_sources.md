## Notes on data handling
- Benchmark visual in the interactive deck is primarily sourced from the local file `benchmark_results_1_1.yaml`.
- The deck includes an embedded fallback series for environments where local `fetch()` of YAML is blocked (common for `file://` browser opens).
- The hands-on exercise is intentionally vendor-neutral and uses a local PDF sample to reduce environment variance.
